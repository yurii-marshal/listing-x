        <div>2079.13. As used in Sections 2079.7 and 2079.14 to 2079.24, inclusive, the following terms have the
            following meanings:
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">(a) </span> “Agent” means a person acting under provisions of Title 9 (commencing with
            Section 2295) in a real
            property transaction, and includes a person who is licensed as a real estate broker under Chapter 3
            (commencing with Section 10130) of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Business and Professions Code, and under
            whose license a listing is executed or an offer to purchase is obtained. The agent in the real property
            transaction bears responsibility for that agent's salespersons or broker associates who perform as
            agents of the agent. When a salesperson or broker associate owes a duty to any principal, or to any
            buyer or seller who is not a principal, in a real property transaction, that duty is equivalent to the
            duty owed to that party by the broker for whom the salesperson or broker associate functions.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">(b) </span> “Buyer” means a transferee in a real property transaction, and includes a
            person who executes an offer to
            purchase real property from a seller through an agent, or who seeks the services of an agent in more than a
            casual, transitory, or preliminary manner, with the object of entering into a real property transaction.
            “Buyer” includes vendee or lessee of real property. <span class="fw-bold">(c) </span> “Commercial real
            property” means all real property
            in the state, except (1) single-family residential real property, (2) dwelling units made subject to Chapter
            2 (commencing with Section 1940) of Title 5, (3) a mobilehome, as defined in Section 798.3, (4) vacant land,
            or (5) a recreational vehicle, as defined in Section 799.29. <span class="fw-bold">(d) </span> “Dual agent”
            means an agent acting, either
            directly or through a salesperson or broker associate, as agent for both the seller and the buyer in a real
            property transaction. <span class="fw-bold">(e) </span> “Listing agreement” means a written contract between
            a seller of real property and
            an agent, by which the agent has been authorized to sell the real property or to find or obtain a buyer,
            including rendering other services for which a real estate license is required to the seller pursuant to the
            terms of the agreement. <span class="fw-bold">(f) </span> “Seller's agent” means a person who has obtained a
            listing of real property to
            act as an agent for compensation. <span class="fw-bold">(g) </span> “Listing price” is the amount expressed
            in dollars specified in the
            listing for which the seller is willing to sell the real property through the seller's agent. <span
                class="fw-bold">(h) </span> “Offering
            price” is the amount expressed in dollars specified in an offer to purchase for which the buyer is willing
            to buy the real property. <span class="fw-bold">(i) </span> “Offer to purchase” means a written contract
            executed by a buyer acting
            through a buyer's agent that becomes the contract for the sale of the real property upon acceptance by the
            seller. <span class="fw-bold">(j) </span> “Real property” means any estate specified by subdivision (1) or
            (2) of Section 761 in property,
            and includes (1) single-family residential property, (2) multiunit residential property with more than four
            dwelling units, (3) commercial real property, (4) vacant land, (5) a ground lease coupled with improvements,
            or (6) a manufactured home as defined in Section 18007 of the Health and Safety Code, or a mobilehome as
            defined in Section 18008 of the Health and Safety Code, when offered for sale or sold through an agent
            pursuant to the authority contained in Section 10131.6 of the Business and Professions Code. <span
                class="fw-bold"><span class="fw-bold">(k) </span> </span> “Real
            property transaction” means a transaction for the sale of real property in which an agent is retained by a
            buyer, seller, or both a buyer and seller to act in that transaction, and includes a listing or an offer to
            purchase. <span class="fw-bold">(l) </span> “Sell,” “sale,” or “sold” refers to a transaction for the
            transfer of real property from the
            seller to the buyer and includes exchanges of real property between the seller and buyer, transactions for
            the creation of a real property sales contract within the meaning of Section 2985, and transactions for the
            creation of a leasehold exceeding one year's duration. <span class="fw-bold">(m) </span> “Seller” means the
            transferor in a real property
            transaction and includes an owner who lists real property with an agent, whether or not a transfer results,
            or who receives an offer to purchase real property of which he or she is the owner from an agent on behalf
            of another. “Seller” includes both a vendor and a lessor of real property. <span class="fw-bold">(n) </span> “Buyer's agent” means an
            agent who represents a buyer in a real property transaction.

        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">2079.14.</span> A seller's agent and buyer's agent shall provide the seller and buyer
            in a real property
            transaction with a copy of the disclosure form specified in Section 2079.16, and shall obtain a signed
            acknowledgment of receipt from that seller and buyer, except as provided in Section 2079.15, as follows: (a)
            The seller's agent, if any, shall provide the disclosure form to the seller prior to entering into the
            listing agreement. <span class="fw-bold">(b) </span> The buyer's agent shall provide the disclosure form to
            the buyer as soon as
            practicable prior to execution of the buyer's offer to purchase. If the offer to purchase is not prepared by
            the buyer's agent, the buyer's agent shall present the disclosure form to the buyer not later than the next
            business day after receiving the offer to purchase from the buyer.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">2079.15.</span> In any circumstance in which the seller or buyer refuses to sign an

            soon as practicable, the seller's agent shall disclose to the seller whether the seller's agent is acting in
            the real property transaction as the seller's agent, or as a dual agent representing both the buyer and
            seller. This relationship shall be confirmed in the contract to purchase and sell real property or in a

            addition to the disclosure required by Section 2079.14. An agent's duty to provide
            disclosure and confirmation of representation in this section may be performed by a real estate salesperson
            or broker associate affiliated with that broker.

            <span class="fw-bold">2079.19 </span> The payment of compensation or the obligation to pay compensation to
            an agent by the seller or buyer is not necessarily determinative of a particular
            agency relationship between an agent and the seller or buyer. A listing agent and a selling agent may agree
            to share any compensation or commission paid, or any
            right to any compensation or commission for which an obligation arises as the result of a real estate
            transaction, and the terms of any such agreement shall not
            necessarily be determinative of a particular relationship.

            agent may not, without the express permission of the buyer, disclose to the seller any confidential
            information obtained from the buyer. <span class="fw-bold">(c)</span> “Confidential information”
            means facts relating to the client's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other
            personal information that may impact price, such as the seller is willing to
            accept a price less than the listing price or the buyer is willing to pay a price greater than the price
            offered. <span class="fw-bold">(d)</span> This section does not alter in any way the duty or
