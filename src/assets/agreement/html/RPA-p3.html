        <div class="text-justify">
            A real estate broker (Broker), whether a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship, may represent more
            than one buyer
            or seller. This multiple representation can occur through an individual licensed as a broker or salesperson
            or through different
            individual broker's or salespersons (associate licensees) acting under the Broker's license. The associate
            licensees may be
            working out of the same or different office locations.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">Multiple Buyers:</span> Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may
            be working with many prospective buyers at
            the same time. These prospective buyers may have an interest in, and make offers on, the same properties.
            Some of these
            properties may be listed with Broker and some may not. Broker will not limit or restrict any particular
            buyer from making an
            offer on any particular property whether or not Broker represents other buyers interested in the same
            property.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">Multiple Sellers:</span> Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may
            have listings on many properties at the same
            time. As a result, Broker will attempt to find buyers for each of those listed properties. Some listed
            properties may appeal to
            the same prospective buyers. Some properties may attract more prospective buyers than others. Some of these
            prospective
            buyers may be represented by Broker and some may not. Broker will market all listed properties to all
            prospective buyers
            whether or not Broker has another or other listed properties that may appeal to the same prospective buyers.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">Dual Agency:</span> If Seller is represented by Broker, Seller acknowledges that
            broker may represent prospective buyers
            of Seller's property and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both seller and buyer in that
            transaction. If Buyer
            is represented by Broker, buyer acknowledges that Broker may represent sellers of property that Buyer is
            interested in
            acquiring and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both buyer and seller with regard to that
            property.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            In the event of dual agency, seller and buyer agree that: a dual agent may not, without the express
            permission of the
            respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts
            relating to either the
            buyer's or seller's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that
            may impact price,
            including the seller's willingness to accept a price less than the listing price or the buyer's willingness
            to pay a price
            greater than the price offered; and except as set forth above, a dual agent is obligated to disclose known
            facts materially
            affecting the value or desirability of the Property to both parties.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            <span class="fw-bold">Offers not necessarily confidential:</span> Buyer is advised that seller or listing
            agent may disclose the existence, terms, or
            conditions of buyer's offer unless all parties and their agent have signed a written confidentiality
            agreement. Whether any such
            information is actually disclosed depends on many factors, such as current market conditions, the prevailing
            practice in the real
            estate community, the listing agent's marketing strategy and the instructions of the seller.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            Buyer and seller understand that Broker may represent more than one buyer or more than one seller and even
            both buyer
            and seller on the same transaction and consents to such relationships.

            Seller and/or Buyer acknowledges reading and understanding this Possible Representation of More Than One
