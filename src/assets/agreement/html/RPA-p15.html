            <div class="item-pl-3">
                The physical condition of the land and improvements being purchased is not
                guaranteed by either Seller or Brokers. You have an affirmative duty to exercise reasonable care to
                protect yourself, including discovery
                of the legal, practical and technical implications of disclosed facts, and the investigation and
                verification of information and facts that you
                know or that are within your diligent attention and observation. A general physical inspection typically
                does not cover all aspects of the
                Property nor items affecting the Property that are not physically located on the Property. If the
                professionals recommend further
                investigations, including a recommendation by a pest control operator to inspect inaccessible areas of
                the Property, you should contact
                qualified experts to conduct such additional investigations.

                Brokers do not have expertise in all areas and therefore cannot advise you on many items, such as

                performance.
