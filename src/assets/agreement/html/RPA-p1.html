                When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you
                should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship or representation you wish to have
                with the agent in the transaction.

            <div>
                A Seller's agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as the agent for the Seller only. A
                Seller's agent or a subagent of that agent has the following affirmative obligations:
            </div>
            <div>
                To the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the
                Seller.
            </div>
            <div>
                To the Buyer and the Seller:

            <div class="item-pl-3">
                (a)&nbsp; Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties.

                    of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the
                    parties. An
                    agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained from the
                    other

                BUYER'S AGENT
            </div>
            <div>
                A Buyer's agent can, with a Buyer's consent, agree to act as agent for the Buyer only. In these
                situations, the agent is not the Seller's agent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation
                for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Seller. An agent acting only for a Buyer has
                the following affirmative obligations:
            </div>
            <div>
                To the Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the

                AGENT REPRESENTING BOTH SELLER AND BUYER
            </div>
            <div>
                A real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more salespersons and broker associates,
                can legally be the agent of both the Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge
                and consent of both the Seller and the Buyer.
            </div>
            <div>
                In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Seller and
                the Buyer:
            </div>
            <div class="item-pl-3">
                (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the
                Seller or the Buyer.
                <br>
                (b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective sections.
            </div>
            <div>
                In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the
                respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to,
                facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's financial position, motivations, bargaining position,
                or other personal information that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a
                price less than the listing price or the Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the price
                offered.
            </div>
            <div class="fw-bold">
                SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES
            </div>
            <div>
                Either the purchase agreement or a separate document will contain a confirmation of which agent is
                representing you and whether that agent is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as
                dual agent. Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure it accurately reflects your
                understanding of your agent's role.
            </div>
            <div>
                The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or Buyer from the
                responsibility to protect his or her own interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure
                that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is a person
                qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent
                professional.
            </div>
            <div>
                If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including as to
                those facts about the property which are known to you or within your diligent attention and observation.
            </div>
            <div>
                Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional
                because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change.
            </div>
            <div>Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure form, depending upon
                the number of agents assisting in the transaction. The law requires each agent with whom you have more
                than a casual relationship to present you with this disclosure form. You should read its contents each
                time it is presented to you, considering the relationship between you and the real estate agent in your
                specific transaction.
