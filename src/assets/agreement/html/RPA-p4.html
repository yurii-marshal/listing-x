            The ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all
            parts of our lives.
            At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many
            businesses
            have been victimized and the real estate business is no exception.
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify">
            While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise extreme
            caution.
            Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be legitimate.
            Reports
            indicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account
            information and, by
            altering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers were
            able to provide
            false phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim
            called the number
            provided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone
            other than the
            intended recipient.
        </div>
        <div class="fw-bold">
            ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED:
            <ol class="item-pl-4 text-left">
                <li>
                    Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, or
                    Landlords at the beginning of the transaction.
                </li>
                <li>DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO
                    CONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE
                    PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number included
                    in any emailed transfer instructions.
                </li>
                <li>Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number,
                    account numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person or
                    over the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord.</li>
                <li>Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps include
                    creating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer instructions, immediately
            notify your
            bank, and the other party, and the Escrow Office, Landlord, or Property Manager. The sources below, as well
