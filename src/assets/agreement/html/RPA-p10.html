                            If Buyer or Seller gives written notice of cancellation pursuant to rights duly exercised
                            under the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to Sign mutual instructions to cancel
                            the sale and escrow and release deposits, if
                            any, to the party entitled to the funds, less fees and costs incurred by that party. Fees
                            and costs may be payable to service providers
                            and vendors for services and products provided during escrow. Except as specified below,
                            <span class="fw-bold">
                                release of funds will require mutual
                                Signed release instructions from the Parties, judicial decision or arbitration award.
                            </span> If
                            either Party fails to execute mutual
                            instructions to cancel escrow, one Party may make a written demand to Escrow Holder for the
                            deposit. (C.A.R. Form BDRD or SDRD).
                            Escrow Holder, upon receipt, shall promptly deliver notice of the demand to the other Party.
                            If, within 10 Days After Escrow Holder's
                            notice, the other Party does not object to the demand, Escrow Holder shall disburse the
                            deposit to the Party making the demand. If
                            Escrow Holder complies with the preceding process, each Party shall be deemed to have
                            released Escrow Holder from any and all
                            claims or liability related to the disbursal of the deposit. Escrow Holder, at its
                            discretion, may nonetheless require mutual cancellation
                            instructions. 
                            <span class="fw-bold">A Party may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for refusal to sign
                                cancellation instructions if no good
                                faith dispute exists as to who is entitled to the deposited funds (Civil Code §1057.3).</span>
