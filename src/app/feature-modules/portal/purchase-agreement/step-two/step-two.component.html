                When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you

              <div>
                To the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the

                A real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more salespersons and broker associates,
                can legally be the agent of both the Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge
                and consent of both the Seller and the Buyer.
              </div>
              <div>
                In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Seller and
                the Buyer:
              </div>
              <div class="item-pl-3">
                (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the
                Seller or the Buyer.
                <br>
                (b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective sections.
              </div>
              <div>
                In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the
                respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to,
                facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's financial position, motivations, bargaining position,
                or other personal information that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a
                price less than the listing price or the Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the price
                offered.

              </div>
              <div>
                Either the purchase agreement or a separate document will contain a confirmation of which agent is
                representing you and whether that agent is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as
                dual agent. Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure it accurately reflects your
                understanding of your agent's role.
              </div>
              <div>
                The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or Buyer from the
                responsibility to protect his or her own interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure
                that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is a person
                qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent
                professional.
              </div>
              <div>
                If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including as to
                those facts about the property which are known to you or within your diligent attention and observation.
              </div>
              <div>
                Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional
                because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change.
              </div>
              <div>Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure form, depending
                upon
                the number of agents assisting in the transaction. The law requires each agent with whom you have more
                than a casual relationship to present you with this disclosure form. You should read its contents each
                time it is presented to you, considering the relationship between you and the real estate agent in your
                specific transaction.

              transaction bears responsibility for that agent's salespersons or broker associates who perform as
              agents of the agent. When a salesperson or broker associate owes a duty to any principal, or to any

              expressed
              in dollars specified in the
              listing for which the seller is willing to sell the real property through the seller's agent. <span

              The ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all
              parts of our lives.
              At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many
              businesses
              have been victimized and the real estate business is no exception.
            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
              While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise
              extreme
              caution.
              Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be
              legitimate.
              Reports
              indicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account
              information and, by
              altering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers
              were
              able to provide
              false phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim
              called the number
              provided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone
              other than the
              intended recipient.

            <div class="fw-bold">
              ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED:
              <ol class="item-pl-4 text-left">
                <li>
                  Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, or
                  Landlords at the beginning of the transaction.
                </li>
                <li>DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO
                  CONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE
                  PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number included
                  in any emailed transfer instructions.
                </li>
                <li>Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number,
                  account numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person or
                  over the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord.
                </li>
                <li>Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps include
                  creating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services.

                The physical condition of the land and improvements being purchased is not
                guaranteed by either Seller or Brokers. You have an affirmative duty to exercise reasonable care to
                protect yourself, including discovery
                of the legal, practical and technical implications of disclosed facts, and the investigation and
                verification of information and facts that you
                know or that are within your diligent attention and observation. A general physical inspection typically
                does not cover all aspects of the
                Property nor items affecting the Property that are not physically located on the Property. If the
                professionals recommend further
                investigations, including a recommendation by a pest control operator to inspect inaccessible areas of
                the Property, you should contact
                qualified experts to conduct such additional investigations.

            <div>
              As of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798.100)
              (“CCPA”)
              grants to California residents certain rights in their private, personal information that is collected by
              companies with whom they do business. Under the CCPA, “personal information” is defined broadly to
              encompass
              non-public records information that could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you, including,
              potentially, photographs of or sales information about your property. Some of your personal information
              will
              be collected and likely shared with others during the process of buying and selling real estate. Depending
              on the situation, you may have the right to “opt out” or stop the transfer of your personal information to
              others and request that certain businesses delete your personal information altogether. Not all businesses
              you interact with are required to comply with the law, primarily just those who meet the criteria of a
              covered “Business” as set forth in Section 1798.140 (c)]. For more information, you may ask your Broker
              for
              a copy of the C.A.R. Legal Q&A on the subject.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
              A real estate broker is likely to submit personal information to a Multiple Listing Service (“MLS”) in
              order
              to help find a buyer for a seller's property. Through the MLS, the information is made available to real
              estate brokers and salespeople, and others. Even after a sale is complete, the MLS distributes sales
              information to the real estate community. Brokers, agents and MLSs may also share your personal
              information
              with others who post the personal information on websites or elsewhere, or otherwise use it. Thus, there
              are
              various service providers and companies in a real estate transaction who may be engaged in using or
              sharing
              data involving your personal information.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
              If your broker is a covered Business, it should have a privacy policy explaining your rights on its
              website
              and giving you an opportunity to request that personal information not be shared, used and even deleted.
              Even if your real estate brokerage is a covered Business, it needs, and is allowed, to keep your
              information
              to effectuate a sale and, by law, is required to maintain such information for three years to comply with
              regulatory requirements. Not all brokers are covered Businesses, however, and those that are not, do not
              have to comply with the CCPA.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
              Similarly, most MLSs will not be considered a covered Business. Instead, the MLS may be considered a Third
              Party in the event a covered Business (ex: brokerages, real estate listing aggregation or advertising
              internet sites or other outlets who meet the criteria of covered Businesses) exchanges personal
              information
              with the MLS. You do not have the right under the CCPA to require a Third Party to delete your personal
              information. And like real estate brokerages, even if an MLS is a covered Business, MLSs are also required
              by law to retain and make accessible in its computer system any and all listing and other information for
              three years.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
              Whether an MLS is a covered Business or a Third Party, you have a right to be notified about the sharing
              of
              your personal information and your right to contact a covered Business to opt out of your personal
              information being used, or shared with Third Parties. Since the MLSs and/or other entities receiving your
              personal information do not have direct contact with buyers and sellers and also may not be aware of which
              entities exchanging personal information are covered Businesses, this form is being used to notify you of
              your rights under the CCPA and your ability to direct requests to covered Businesses not to share personal
              information with Third Parties. One way to limit access to your personal information, is to inform your
              broker or salesperson you want to opt-out of the MLS, and if so, you will be asked to sign a document
              (Form
              SELM) confirming your request to keep your listing off the MLS. However, if you do so, it may be more
              difficult to sell your property or obtain the highest price for it because your property will not be
              exposed
              to the greatest number of real estate licensees and others.
